## Up Next: Privacy Policy
[Up Next](/up-next) is a free extension for the Google Chrome browser that shows the next calendar appointment in your day. It currently only supports Google Calendar, and Chrome version 78 and higher.

### The privacy policy for Up Next is simple:
We do not, and will not, collect any personal data. Our Chrome extension operates locally, and does not use any third-party servers to process your data. Here's what you need to know:

1. Your calendar is retrieved directly from Google by your browser using encryption, and only stored locally. That means it never reaches our servers, and we can't ever see what's on your calendar. 
2. We don't access your calendar directly, ever, and the data is not sent to any third parties.
3. The extension tracks two data points using Google Analytics over an encrypted connection: an aggregate number of installs, and a total amount of times the new tab page has been seen. No other information is collected, sent to our servers, or stored in any way. 

The Chrome extension does not share any data about your calendar, usage, or any other information with third parties. Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted here, and you will be notified via the Chrome extension if this occurs.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, or want to know more, contact: [owen@char.gd](mailto:owen@char.gd).
