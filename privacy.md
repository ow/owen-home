## What's Up Next?
[Up Next](/up-next) is a free extension for the Google Chrome browser that shows the next calendar appointment in your day. It currently only supports Google Calendar, and Chrome version 78 and higher.

### The privacy policy for Up Next is simple:
1. Your calendar is retrieved directly from Google by your browser, and only stored locally. That means it never reaches our servers, and we can't ever see what's on your calendar. 
2. We don't access your calendar directly, ever, and the data is not sent to any third parties.
3. The extension only tracks two data points, anonymously: an aggregate number of installs, and when a user opens a tab. That's it! 

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, or want to know more, contact: owen@char.gd.
