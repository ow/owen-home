## Hello, Toronto!

The last two months have been consumed by moving countryâ€“getting settled in and setting up a house is one thing, but finding furniture and things you like to decorate it is way harder than expected! 

## Back to work

I've officially started at Shopify now and we're already knee-deep in making the world better with words for the developer experience there. As a coincedence, I'm [hiring a content strategist for my team, so join me!](https://www.shopify.com/careers/product-content-strategist-developer-experience-1ef1f0)

## What even is a routine?

The hardest thing about moving country is the total routine reset. I don't really have a set schedule yet like I did at home, and I'm trying to find the best times to send my newsletters, let alone things like heading to the gym, reading time, or general logging off. But hey, life takes a bit of time to get back to normal, I guess.
