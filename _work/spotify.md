I worked closely with Spotify's team to help build a next-generation design system. Encore isn't a single design system, it's family of design systems, managed by distributed teams. Spotify had more than 100 different types of hardware running its software, making it impossible to evolve patterns over time. 

We worked across the company to untangle hundreds of unique components, making it simpler for teams to ship consistent, beautiful experiences to their usersâ€”without compromising on speed.
