Working closely with Clearbit's internal marketing team, I helped transform their existing web-based content into a e-book, and eventually a physical book.

We looked at the content already published on Clearbit's fantastic blog, and adapted the relevant bits into a book that didn't feel like just another rehash of content that's already out there.
