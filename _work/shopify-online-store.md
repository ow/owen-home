My team brought an official GitHub integration to Shopify as a part of the Online Store 2.0 launch. 

Previously, developers needed to work on their theme locally, zip it up, then upload it to Shopify manually to test it. 

The GitHub integration removed this friction and allowed developers to dramatically speed up their workflows by having their changes deployed from GitHub automatically.  

This work involved a deep GitHub integration, and overhauling the theme platform to allow safe continuous deployment of themes, as well as providing great developer workflows for testing changes ahead of deploying.
