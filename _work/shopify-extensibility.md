I led a team working on a transformation of how developers can extend into the Shopify dashboard, checkout, and beyond, with third-party apps. 

We crafted an marketplace-first strategy that would see Shopify introduce the ability to subscribe to physical products for the first time. Instead of building it into the core platform, we built platform primitives and extension frameworks that enabled developers to unlock the functionaltiy for merchants.
