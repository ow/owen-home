With DigitalOcean's in-house marketing team, I helped build landing pages that convert, and worked closely with the team to define the page layout, elements and success criteria.

We created a wide array of pages, covering topics from MySQL to Node.JS, designed to be inherently useful to developers, rather than just spout a bunch of SEO nonsense.
