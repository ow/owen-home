With SPACE10, IKEA's innovation lab in Copenhagen, I explored what a chat-based personality under the IKEA brand might feel to interact with, and built out prototype experiences.

Over the space of six months, we designed a UX Writing framework, the content itself, and the experience as a part of the chatbot exploration, ultimately building a usable product.
