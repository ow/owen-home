							<p>Because I've been in the trenches as a developer *and* writer, I know all about the tech jargon that matters, from Node.JS to GCP.</p>
							<p>Today, I help great teams get to their potential by making technology friendlier with words, and help product teams build their UX writing discipline, or position themselves in a crowded, jargon-laden startup world.</p>
							<p>Oh, and I write a weekly column about how technology is shaping the world for Medium's OneZero, called <a href="https://medium.com/one-zero/debugger/home" target="_blank">Debugger</a>.</p>

			<h5>What</h5>
			<p>I run my own business. It started with Charged in 2013, a weekly newsletter delivered to 15,000 people.</p><p>Today, it's also a paid daily service with 400 members and I deliver it Tuesday - Friday mornings. Oh, and helping people like you, too.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4">
		<h5>Where</h5>
			<p>I'm in the middle of moving to Toronto, Canada, but right now I live in <strong class="font-weight-bold">Amsterdam, Netherlands</strong> with <a href="https://femke.co.nz">my partner</a> and our fluffy scottish-straight <a href="https://instagram.com/mikastgram">cat</a>.</p>
			<p>I spent the better part of my life in Wellington, New Zealand, one of my favorite places in the world. We invented the flat white there.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4">
			<h5>Weird</h5>
			<p>When I'm not working, I love to read, bake and hike. I'm a little obsessed with finding new music, too.</p>
			<p>I'm an avid Twitter user, and joined the service in 2008. I didn't get my short username until much later, but that's a story for in person.</p>
