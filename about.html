							<p>Because I've been in the trenches as a developer and writer, I know all about the tech jargon that matters, from NodeJS to AWS.</p>
							<p>Today, I'm Content Design Manager at Shopify in Toronto, building the future of our developer experience. Oh, and I write a weekly column about how technology is shaping the world for Medium's OneZero, <a href="https://medium.com/one-zero/debugger/home" target="_blank">DEBUGGER</a>.</p>

			<h5>What</h5>
			<p>For the last few years, I ran a freelance UX writing and consulting business. It started with Charged in 2013, a weekly newsletter delivered to 15,000 people, and grew into helping others with words for more than three years.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4">
		<h5>Where</h5>
			<p>I live in Toronto, Canada, and previously lived in <strong class="font-weight-bold">Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong> with <a href="https://femke.co.nz">my partner</a> and our fluffy scottish-straight <a href="https://instagram.com/mikastgram">cat</a>, Mika.</p>
			<p>My accent will betray me, however, as I grew up in Wellington, New Zealand, one of my favorite places in the world. We invented the flat white there.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4">
			<h5>Weird</h5>
			<p>When I'm not working, I love to read, bake and hike. I'm a little obsessed with finding new music, too.</p>
			<p>I'm an <a href="https://twitter.com/ow" target="_blank">avid Twitter user</a>, and joined the service in 2008. I didn't get my short username until much later, but that's a story for in person.</p>
