			<h5>What</h5>
			<p>Before Stripe and Shopify, I ran a freelance UX strategy and consulting business.</p>
			<p>It started with <a href="https://char.gd">Charged</a> in 2013, a weekly newsletter delivered to 15,000 people, and grew into helping others with UX strategy for more than three years.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4">
		<h5>Where</h5>
			<p>I live in <strong class="font-weight-bold">Victoria, British Columbia</strong>, with <a href="https://femke.co.nz">my partner</a> and our beautiful Duck Tolling Retriever, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGvcxQZMRIl/">Kaya</a>.</p>
			<p>Before we moved to Canada in 2019, we lived in Amsterdam, The Netherlands for 5 years, but I grew up in Wellington, New Zealand (we invented the flat white).</p>

			<h5>Weird</h5>
			<p>When I'm not working, I love to read, bake, and hike. I'm a little obsessed with finding new music, too.</p>
			<p>I'm an <a href="https://twitter.com/ow" target="_blank">avid Twitter user</a>, and joined the service in 2008. I didn't get my short username until much later, but that's a story for in person.</p>
